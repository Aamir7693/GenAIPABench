TE,"Yes, the policy does outline data collection practices. The key points are:

Types of Information Collected: This includes content, communications, and other information provided when using the products. This can be things like photos, messages, metadata (e.g., location of a photo, date a file was created), and features utilized (e.g., camera for mask and filter suggestions). The policy also covers data with special protections like religious views, political views, health data, racial or ethnic origin, philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership.

Networks and Connections: Data about people, accounts, hashtags, and Facebook groups and Pages that the user is connected to and interacts with is collected. Contact information is also collected if the user chooses to upload, sync, or import it from a device.

Usage Information: This includes data about how the products are used, the types of content viewed or engaged with, actions taken, and the time, frequency, and duration of activities.

Transaction Information: If purchases or financial transactions are made using the products, details about the purchase or transaction, including payment information, account and authentication information, and billing, shipping, and contact details, are collected.

Information Provided by Others: The policy also covers information that others provide about the user, such as when others share or comment on a user's photo, send a message, or upload, sync, or import the user's contact information.

Device Information: Information is collected from and about devices used to access the products, like computers, phones, connected TVs, and other web-connected devices. This information can be combined across different devices the user uses.

In general, information is processed to support the products and services, and the types of information collected depend on how the user uses the products. Part 1"

UCE,"Yes, Facebook did provide users with controls over their privacy settings. Part 3"
UCM,"Yes, clear mechanisms exist for users to request data deletion or access. Users can access, rectify, port, and erase their data through their Facebook and Instagram settings. Data is stored until it's no longer necessary for providing services, or until the user's account is deleted. Specific examples given include being able to access and delete search queries, with logs of searches being deleted after 6 months, and copies of government-issued IDs submitted for verification being deleted after 30 days. When a user deletes their account, their posted content, like photos and status updates, are deleted and cannot be recovered, but information others have shared about the user isn't part of the user's account and won't be deleted. If a user doesn't want to delete their account permanently, they can choose to deactivate it temporarily.  Part 3"
UCH,"We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data. Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings. [This indicates that users have control over their data and can manage it through the settings of their Facebook and Instagram accounts.] We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Meta Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. [This suggests that data is retained only as long as necessary, and users have the option to delete their accounts.] This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. [This indicates that data retention is subject to various factors and considerations.] When you delete your account, we delete things you have posted, such as your photos and status updates, and you won't be able to recover that information later. [This confirms that deleting an account removes user-generated content.] Information that others have shared about you isn't part of your account and won't be deleted. [This clarifies that content shared by others about the user is not deleted when the account is deleted.] If you don't want to delete your account but want to temporarily stop using the Products, you can deactivate your account instead. [This provides an alternative option for users who want to temporarily suspend their account without permanently deleting it.] To delete your account at any time, please visit the Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings.(Part 3)"
DME,"Yes, We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Meta Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first. [This indicates that the company retains data for as long as it is needed for service provision or until the user deletes their account.] This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. [This implies that data retention periods are assessed individually, considering factors such as the type of data, the purpose of collection and processing, and any legal or operational requirements.] Part 3"
